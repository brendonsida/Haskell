Installing and Running Haskell

1.  Installation
    There are many methods of installing Haskell onto your machine. 
    Below is a simple method of going about it:
    
    *   Stack build tool
        This is by far the easiest way to get started with Haskell. 
        This will automate the installation and management 
        of the GHC compiler, libraries and other build tools.
        To install:
        
        For Mac OSX users:
          Run the following command into the terminal window:
          $ curl -sSL https://get.haskellStack.org/ | sh
          
        For Linux users:
          Run the following command into the terminal window:
          $ wget -q0- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
          
        For Windows users:
          There are installers for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems.
          You can find the downloads here:
          https://haskell-lang.org/get-started/windows
    
2.  Running the Haskell Interpreter
    Once installed, open a terminal and type 'ghci' (no apostrophes) 
    at the command prompt. If on Windows, you choose WinGHCI in the
    start menu. Once that is done, you will be presented with a prompt 
    that awaits your input.
    
    Alternatively, you can compile an already existing program by
    using the following command:
    
    $ ghci [command-line-options-and-input-files]
